# 🎮 Guess The Number (Java)

A **console-based number guessing game** built in **Java** with difficulty levels, input validation, and score tracking.  
This project demonstrates **control structures, loops, input handling, random number generation, and game logic** in Java.

- 🔢 **Hints** – Tells you whether your guess is *too high* or *too low*  
- 🏆 **Best Score Tracker** – Shows the fewest attempts made in a session  
- 📊 **Attempt Limit** – Based on optimal binary search logic (≈ log₂(range) + 1)  
- 🔁 **Replay Option** – Continue playing until you choose to exit
